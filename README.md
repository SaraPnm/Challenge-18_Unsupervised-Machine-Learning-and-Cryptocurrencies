# Challenge 18, Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview
In this challenge,  weâ€™ll use unsupervised machine learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market.. 
The goals of this challenge are to:

1. Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
2. Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
3. Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
4. Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

## Resources
Python 3.7

## Summary
We took the steps below in order to apply an unsupervised machine learning model to the cryptocurrencies dataset:
- cleaning the original dataset
- applying standard scaler to the pre-processed data
- reducing data dimensions using PCA
- clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means (plotting elbow curve, and trying different k values to find the optimum k)
- visualizing the results
